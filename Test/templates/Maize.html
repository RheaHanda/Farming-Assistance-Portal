          <p class="generalpara">Maize (Zea mays L) is second rated grain that is used collectively in form of foodstuff or fodder. Globally, maize is known as queen of cereals because it has highest genetic yield potential among the cereals. Grains provides food items which are consumed in the form of starch, corn flakes also glucose. It is also used as animal feed in poultry. Maize can be cultivated in any soil as they require less fertile soil and various chemicals. Moreover, it fetch less ripening span, 3 months, in comparison to paddy, which takes 145 days.</p>
          <p class="generalpara" id="morecontent">By growing maize, farmers can easily shield the deteriorating grade of soil , preserve 90% of water and 70% of potency as compared with paddy and can make more profit than wheat and paddy,” reported by vice chancellor, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana. It serves as basic raw material to thousands of industrial products like oil, starch, alcoholic beverages etc. Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, J & K and Punjab are Major Maize growing states. AP and Karnataka is major producer of maize in south.</p>

          <p class="generalpara">Fertile well-drained alluvial or simply red loams free of coarse elements and full off nitrogen are ideal soils for maize cultivation. Maize can be grown on wide range of soils including loamy sand to clay loam. Definitely depleted plains are effective suited to the cultivation, even though it grows up in various hilly zones equally. Soils with fine organic matter containing good water holding capacity with pH ranging from 5.5-7.5 are required to increased yield. Heavy clay soil is not suitable for cultivation.</p>
          <p class="generalpara" id="morecontent2">Soil test is necessary to know deficiency of any nutrient in the soil.</p>

        <div class="heading">SOWING</div>
          <p class="generalpara"><b>Time of sowing
          </b>In kharif season, crop is sown in month of May end to June corresponding with the onset of monsoon. Spring crops are sown during late February to end of march. Plantation of baby corn can be done all the year round, except December and January. Kharif and rabi season are best for sweet corn sowing.</p>
          <b>Spacing
            </b>To obtain higher yield along with resource-use efficiency, optimum plant spacing is the key factor.  
            1) For kharif maize : use spacing of 60x20 cm.
            2) Sweet corn : use spacing of 60x20 cm spacing.
            3) Baby corn: Use 60x20 cm or 60x15 cm spacing.
            4) Pop corn: Use 50x15 cm spacing.
            5) Fodder: use spacing of 30x10 cm spacing<p>
            
            <b>Sowing Depth
            </b>Seed should be sown at depth of 3-4 cm. For sweet corn cultivation keep depth of sowing to 2.5 cm.<p>
            
            <b>Method of sowing
            </b>Sowing can be done manually by dibbling seeds or by mechanically with help of tractor drawn ridger seed drill.</p>

          <p class="generalpara">For cultivation selected land should be free from weeds and remains of previously grown crop. Plough the land to bring the soil to fine tilth. It may take 6 to 7 plough. Apply 4-6 tons/acre of well decomposed cow dung across the field, also apply 10 Azospirillum packets in field. Prepared furrow and ridges with 45 cm to 50 cm spacing.</p>
