        <p class="generalpara">"The coconut palm is referred to as 'Kalpavriksha' - the 'tree of heaven' as each and every part of the palm is useful to mankind in one way or another. It provides food, drink, fuel and timber. Millions of families in India depend on coconut for their livelihood either directly or indirectly. India ranks third in area and production of coconut in the world. The four southern states viz . Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are the major coconut producing states in India accounting for more than 90 percent of area and production. There is a great scope for enhancing the productivity of coconut through adoption of scientific cultivation technologies.".</p>

        <div class="heading">SOIL</div>
        <p class="generalpara">Red sandy loam, laterite and alluvial soils are suitable. Select sites with deep (not less than 1.5 m depth) well drained soil heavy, imperfectly drained soil is unsuitable. Avoid shallow soils with underlying hard rock, low-lying areas subject to water stagnation and heavy clayey soils. Soil with a minimum depth of 1.2 m and fairly good water holding capacity is preferred for coconut cultivation. However, in lands, reclaimed by heaping alternate layers of sand and clay, coconut thrives well. Proper supply of moisture either through well distributed rainfall or irrigation and sufficient drainage are essential for coconut. Coconut can be grown in soil with a pH of 5.2 – 8.6.</p>

            <br><br>
           <b>5.Tiptur Tall=</b> Another famous variety of the coconut which is widely cultivated in the southern state of Karnataka. It contains around 68% of oil content and the fruiting usually occurs after 6-7 years. The variety produces 70-80 coconuts per tree on average, with 6-12 inches long.
             <br><br>
            <b>6.Kera Sagara=</b>A popular cultivar in the south Indian state of Kerala. The variety takes almost 6-8 years before it can start producing fruits. It is also a tall coconut variety that has 68-70% oil content. An average yield of this coconut variety is 90-100 fruits per tree every year.
              <br><br>
              <b>7.Kerachandra=</b>This variety of coconut can also grow in a wide range of soils and produces an average of 100-110 fruits per tree every year. It is suitable for commercial cultivation in all states. It takes around 5 years to produce fruits. The oil content in this type of coconut is 66-68%.

        <div class="heading">LAND PREPARATION</div>
        <p class="generalpara">
            The nature of preparation of land before planting depends upon topography of land, soil type and other environmental factors. The area should be cleaned and planting holes marked out at appropriate places. If the land is sloppy, soil conservation methods should be adopted. If the groundwater level is high planting may be taken up in the mounds. On slopes and in areas of undulating terrain, prepare the land by contour terracing or bunding. In low-lying areas and rice fields, form mounds to a height of at least 1 m above water level. In reclaimed kayal areas, planting can be done on the field bunds.</p>

      <div class="generalinfo">
        <div class="heading">WEED CONTROL</div>
        <p class="generalpara">Weeding and Intercultural: Keep the pits free of weeds by periodical weeding. Remove the soil covering the collar of seedlings. As the seedlings grow and form a stem, fill up the pits gradually by cutting the sides. Proper intercultivation provides control of weeds and creates soil mulch. Any tillage system (plowing, digging, raking or forming mounds) that provides soil mulch and control weeds may be followed depending upon local conditions. The interspace in the coconut garden has to be plowed twice in a year in June - July and December - January For laterite, sandy and red sandy loam soils give two plowing or diggings in May-June and September-October and one raking in January. In areas where surface runoff is more, form mounds in September-October and level them in November-December. For the broad-leaved weeds, pre-emergence spraying of atrazine @1.0 kg a.i./ ha for the control of grasses and sedges. Post emergence spraying of glyphosate @ 10 ml and 20 g ammonium Sulfate /liter of water.
            Replanting or Under Planting: Replanting or under planting becomes necessary when the yield is very low due to old age, long-term neglect and continuous exposure to adverse conditions. Generally under planting is practiced where old palms are removed in stages over a period of three to four years.
            Peg marks the area to be under planted.
            Remove very poor yielder and those very close to the planting pits.
            Plant the seedlings in the usual way
            The other trees are removed @ one-third each year during 2nd, 3rd and 4th year after planting.
            If the existing garden is irregularly spaced, remove old palms within 1 m radial distance in first year, 2 m distance in second year, 3 m distance in third year and the rest in fourth year.
            Generally flowering is delayed a little in under planted palms. – CPCRI.</p>

        <div class="heading">IRRIGATION</div>
        <p class="generalpara">Coconut palm responds to summer irrigation. Production of female flowers and setting % increases considerably due to irrigation. Since spadix initiation to ripening of nuts takes nearly 42 months, the full benefit of irrigation can be felt only after 3 years.
            Burying the Coconut husk or coir dust is one of the most effective ways of conserving soil moisture.
            These husks coir dusts can act as sponge and absorb and retain moisture about 6-10 times respectively to their own weight and slowly relative to the coconut trees during dry periods.
            As the husk or dust breaks down slowly, their effect will last for 4-6 years and 8-10 years respectively. On decomposition they also add potash to the soil. These husks or dusts can be added in pits / trenches taken in between the trees but in all the cases depth should be 0.6m and 1.8m away from the bole. Husks / dusts can be added in alternate layers with soil.
            Each palm requires 55 to 120 liters of water every day. Since availability of irrigation water is scanty, for judicious utilization of this resource, adoption of drip irrigation system is most ideal.
            Drip irrigation is known to save about 30 – 40% water with 38% - 40% increase in yield compared to basin irrigation systems apart from conserving soil and reducing the competition from weeds for water and nutrients. Through fertigation, we can achieve efficient utilization of both water and nutrients.
            Drip Irrigation: In the traditional system of irrigation followed in coconut gardens such as flood irrigation, basin irrigation etc. irrigation efficiency is only 30 to 50 per cent due to considerable wastage of water. In addition, the cost of inputs like labor and energy in adopting these systems are high. Scarcity of water and increasing cost of labor and energy are deterrents in adopting these traditional irrigation systems. Under these circumstances, drip irrigation is the most suitable system of irrigation to coconut.</p>
