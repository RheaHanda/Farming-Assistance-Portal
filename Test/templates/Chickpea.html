                <p class="generalpara">Gram commonly known as chick pea or Bengal gram is the most important pulse crop
                    of India. It is used for human consumption as well as for feeding to animals. Fresh green leaves are
                    used as vegetables while straw is chickpea an excellent fodder for cattle. The grains are also used
                    as vegetables. India, Pakistan, Ethiopia, Burma and Turkey are main gram growing countries. India
                    ranks first in the world in respect of production and acreage followed by Pakistan. In India, Madhya
                    Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra and Punjab are major gram producing states.
                    <br><br>
                    On basis of size, color and shape of seeds, gram is divided into two groups 1) Desi or brown gram 2)
                    Kabuli or white gram. Yield potential of kabuli is poor as compared to Desi gram.
