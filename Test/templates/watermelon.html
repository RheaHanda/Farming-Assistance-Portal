                <p class="generalpara">Watermelon originated in South Africa. It is an important cucurbitaceous
                    vegetable in India. It is an excellent desert fruit and its juice contains 92% water along with
                    proteins, minerals and carbohydrates. In Japan, cubic shaped watermelons are popular, they grow
                    watermelons in glass boxes and give them a cubic shape. Watermelons are mainly cultivated in
                    Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh.

                    results when grown on sandy or sandy loam soil. Soil having poor drainage capacity is not suited for
                    watermelon cultivation. Follow crop rotation as continuous growing of the same crop on the same
                    field leads to loss of nutrients, poor yield and more disease attacks. pH of soil should be in
                    between

                    Spacing
                    Depending upon the sowing method spacing may vary. In the pit method use row to row spacing of
                    2-3.5m and 60 cm between two plants.

                    Sowing Depth
                    Plant seed about 2-3cm deep.

                    Method of sowing
                    For sowing different methods of planting like furrow method, Pit method and hill method can be used
                    depending upon climate and season.
                    <br><br>
                    Furrow Method: Sowing is done on either side of furrows. Sow 3-4 seeds (After germination keep only
                    healthy seedling) at a time and keep plant to plant distance of 60-90cm.
                    <br><br>
                    Pit Method: Sow 4 seeds in the pit. For that make pit of 60x60x60cm at a distance of 2-3.5m between
                    two rows and 0.6-1.2m between plants. Fill the pit with well decomposed cow dung and soil. After
                    germination, keep only one seedling.
                    Hill method: Similar to pit method. In this, pit of 30x30x30cm pits are made at a distance of
                    1-1.5m. Two seeds are sown per hill.

At time of applying irrigation, you should not wet the vines or vegetative parts, especially during flowering and fruit-set. Avoid frequent irrigation in heavy soil as it will promote excessive vegetative growth. For better sweetness and flavour, stop irrigation or reduce watering 3-6days before harvesting.
